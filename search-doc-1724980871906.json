Throwing exceptions allows error detection mechanisms to have visibility into these errors and prevents silent failures, which may lead to more severe bugs. By choosing exceptions as the primary method for error handling in Momentum, we ensure that unrecoverable errors are easily detectable, and the Momentum library remains user-friendly for developers interacting with the application layer.  Using exceptions is especially crucial when considering the application layer as the user of the Momentum library. For layers closer to the services, everything should be surrounded by try-catch blocks to prevent server crashes while still providing valuable error information. Python programmers, who often interact with the application layer, typically expect exceptions, making it a more reasonable approach for error handling in Momentum.  One important caution is to avoid using exceptions for flow control; common errors, such as &quot;L2 norm is too high,&quot; should not result in exceptions being thrown.

The [] operator does not perform bounds checking, thus offering better performance. Conversely, the .at() method should be considered for areas of code that might be accessed by the user as it performs bounds checking to prevent out-of-range errors, enhancing the safety of the code.
