# Viewers

Momentum supports various file formats for storing characters and motions. In this section, we demonstrate how to visualize these file formats using Momentum powered by [Rerun](https://rerun.io/).

For simplicity, we have built individual viewers for each file format. Each viewer example may require different arguments. Please use the `--help` option to see the correct usage of each example.

## GLB Viewer

To run the GLB viewer, use the following command:

```
pixi run glb_viewer --input <my_file.glb>
```

## FBX Viewer

To run the FBX viewer, use the following command:

```
pixi run fbx_viewer --input <my_file.fbx>
```

## C3D Viewer

To run the C3D viewer, use the following command:

```
pixi run c3d_viewer --input <my_file.c3d>
```
