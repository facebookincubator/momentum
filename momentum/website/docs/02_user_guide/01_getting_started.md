# Getting Started

This page guides you through the process of building Momentum and running the examples.

## Prerequisite

Complete the following steps only once:

1. Install Pixi by following the instructions on https://prefix.dev/

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/facebookincubator/momentum
   cd momentum
   ```

   Ensure that all subsequent commands are executed in the project's root directory unless specified otherwise.

## Build Momentum

After completing the prerequisites, you are ready to build and use Momentum.

- Build the project with the following command (note that the first run may take a few minutes as it installs all dependencies):

  ```
  pixi run build
  ```

- Run the tests with:

  ```
  pixi run test
  ```

To view all available command lines, run `pixi task list`.

## Running Hello World

To run the `hello_world` example:

```
pixi run hello_world
```

Alternatively, you can directly run the executable:

```
# Linux and macOS
./build/hello_world

# Windows
build/Release/hello_world.exe
```

## Running Example

To run other examples:

```
pixi run glb_viewer --help
```

For more examples, please refer to the [Examples](../examples/viewers) page.

## Clean Up

If you need to start over for any reason:

```
pixi run clean
```

Momentum uses the `build/` directory for CMake builds, `.pixi/` for the Pixi virtual environment, and `.deps/` for building dependencies. You can clean up everything by either manually removing these directories or by running the command above.
