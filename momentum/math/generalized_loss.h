/// This loss transforms a squared error value with parameters alpha and c.
/// Alpha can be approximately thought of as the norm: alpha=2 is the squared L2 norm loss; alpha=1
/// is a soft L1 norm or the L2-L1/pseudo-Huber loss. Alpha controls the effect of "outliers" (ie.
/// "robust"). Smaller alpha reduces the contribution of large errors so they don't affect the
/// result as much. c scales the gradient with respect to the squared error term inversely.
/// This does not implement solving for alpha. It assumes alpha and c are given as input.
